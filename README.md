# SNN-YOLO Cell Detection
Cell detection is enabled with the SNN-YOLO network with neuromorphic imaging data. The current network was trained on Polystyrene-based microparticles in the size of 3, 8, 15 um, THP1 and LL/2 cell lines. 

The performance of the network was compared with conventional YOLOv3 with event-generated frames to serve as a baseline.
