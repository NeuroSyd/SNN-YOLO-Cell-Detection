# NC-Microparticles
This project is dedicated to the publication of NC with MP subjects

Focus: 1. Performance 2. different speeds (1 5 10 25 50 uL/min for 60 sec)

Results figure
- MP under NV compared to normal vision (scale bar, x20)
- Platform
- MP in a channel at a different speed
- Performance 
- Comparison (3 samples in total, one for control, one for different speeds, one for CytoFlex)

Issues await discussion:
- Flow rate to flow velocity (refer to JH paper, ask Shin or Daniele for assistance)
- needs for an event-based figure of subjects (refer to SA paper)
